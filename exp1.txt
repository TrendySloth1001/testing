1. Identify and Provide the PEAS description and TASK Environment for a given AI problem.
(Self-Driving Car)

PEAS:
- Performance measure: avoid collisions, obey traffic laws, passenger comfort, timely arrival, fuel/energy efficiency, passenger satisfaction.
- Environment (sensors): cameras, LiDAR, radar, GPS, IMU, ultrasonic sensors, maps, V2X messages.
- Actuators: steering, throttle, brakes, indicators, lights, horn, gear control, communication outputs.
- Sensors/Actuators summary: perceive lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, signs; control motion and signals.

Task Environment:
- Observable: partially (sensors noisy, occlusions).
- Stochastic and dynamic: other agents and weather affect outcomes.
- Continuous state and action spaces.
- Sequential and real-time with safety-critical constraints.
- Single-agent controller operating in a multi-agent traffic environment.

theory :-
- Pipeline: perception (object detection, segmentation), localization (GPS+SLAM), prediction (other agents), planning (behavior + trajectory planning), control (trajectory tracking).
- Uses sensor fusion, machine learning (deep nets for perception), probabilistic estimation, path-planning algorithms, and feedback control.

advantages:-
- Potentially fewer accidents, increased mobility/accessibility, reduced congestion and energy use, lower human driver burden.

Applications:-
- Autonomous taxis and ride-hailing, last-mile delivery, freight transport, driver-assist systems, accessible transport for disabled/elderly.
